# Getting Started with TDD

This project was inspired by udemy course on react-testing-library. Testing is something which I have always heard people to be scared off, trying to avoid it or give it to someone else. While I think it's really helpful with development if learned and used correctly. They serve as live documentation and potentially saves us from client clashes w.r.t to features.
Most people try to test the implemetation logic with tests while tests are only supposed test the behaviour i.e business feature.

In this repo I'll be adding sample, projects based on various kinds of testing followed/ used by indutry experts :
- Smoke,
- e2e,
- unit
- snapshot

are some of the most popular ones.

## Libraries Used

I have started with the following libraries but the list is not limited :
- jest
- enzyme
- jasmine
- puppetter
